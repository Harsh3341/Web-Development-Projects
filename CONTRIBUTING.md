# Contribution Guide

## New contributor Guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README][1]. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub][2]
- [Set up Git][3]
- [GitHub flow][4]

## How and where to put your code?

1. Select the libraries or framework folder of your project.
2. Select the level of your project.

   Basic- Project which only has HTML and CSS in it.

   Intermediate- Projects which use API.

   Advanced- Projects which are developed on both front and backend.

3. Now make a folder inside the level folder which starts with your Github username and then project name(eg-Harsh3341-NoteApp).
4. Create a README.md in your project folder and describe about your project and add a short video or screenshot in it.

## Make Changes

### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the forked repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Web-Development-Projects
```

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

```bash
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

## Commit your changes

- Commit the changes once you are done with the project. Make sure to add a descriptive commit message.

## Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge
